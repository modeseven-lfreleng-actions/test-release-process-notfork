# Test Release Process

Repository that automatically raises trivial changes on a schedule. Uses the
[release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter/actions)
action to generate draft releases. A workflow runs every morning on a
schedule, generating a new tagged release with an incremented patch/version
number.
